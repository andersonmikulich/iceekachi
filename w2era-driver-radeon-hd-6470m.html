Hi all So I started Elite Dangerous a little while ago and a new update rolled out and this happened: It is basically an invisible rectangle blocking the text in front of the crosshair. Some people said that I have to update my AMD graphics card's software. I am using Intel HD Family and AMD Radeon HD 6470M integrated (Switchable GPUs) I need help updating them.

I always played Fortnite on it with no problems but recently I updated my Radeon drivers and the game started lagging. Не секрет, что понять, насколько та или иная видеокарта быстрее и лучше - очень не просто. I need some help, I've had this computer for a few weeks now, it's running Windows 7 because I hate Windows 10 (for personal reasons) and Firefox has started to act up lately. Basically Youtube videos keep stuttering by getting "stuck" at a certain part of the video for a few seconds. At first I didn't mind this but this is starting to get really annoying fast. Nothing I try is working, rebooting doesn't work, turning off and playing with hardware acceleration settings doesn't work either Драйвер для Canon i-SENSYS LBP7010C, LBP7018C + инструкция. Мне удобно просматривать документы PDF без скачивания с помощью браузеров. Hi TPP'ers you might recognize this as the THIRD installment on my continued grievance with Windows 10. You might recall the lovely time Windows 10 deleted all my documents, (from which I could barely recover some) or when it installed without my permission and locked me out of my computer for days. Or when it told me to jump of a cliff (yes it also did that) Now here we are. I'm writing this from within Safe Mode of a NEW COMPUTER, because I'm having the Black Screen of Death Problem Again.

So I just tested a few custom games before going on to play ranked to be sure everything is ok after the patch, and I noticed Huge fps drops (my laptop could hit 110 fps and now it drops to 30 without teamfight). TEMPORARY SOLUTION : So I dug into it a little and found out that lolclient takes up 50% cpu when the game itself takes about 10-20%. So I fixed the problem by turning the priorities in task manager. That can't be done in every game though, it should be fixed. UPDATE: Apparently. Verifying installation does show, also logging into account and then Steam is "running" yet nothing shows up. Steam used to work flawless before. Haven't changed drivers (this laptop has old AMD Radeon HD 6470M 1GB). Native libraries is set on as always on Steam Linux Integration and 32 bit libraries is set to not forced. Tinkering with these does not seem to help though. Here is the out puts from the terminal: tux@asus ~ $ steam Running Steam on solus 3 64-bit STEAM_RUNTIME is enabled Okay I will quick summarize everything that happened in the past 24 hours. I installed Ubuntu 16.04 2 days ago. Tried to game, couldnt play anything with Ubuntu and Steam forcing Intel HD 3000 GPU. I hop onto Discord (/r/linux_gaming and /r/pcmasterrace) and Linux_Gaming helps me get my GPU working but I get this in game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciFsP2Z-vMI I updated my Kernel and I had more issues so I formatted and installed 16.10. When I ran lspci Hi I have a have an HP Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2620M CPU @ 2.70GHz, with Windowns 10 Pro Version 1607 OS Buid 14393.693. I have been having problems with a blmy screen going black after a few moments after booting my C. I have had a similar problem before where my screen remained black before logging, I resolved that issue by unstalling my display driver (Radeon AM) and letting windows reinstall it again. However yesterday, the problem returned, however it was different the computer works I recently bought a refurbished laptop from Newegg, and so far everything about it is perfect except one thing. Here are the specs: HP EliteBook 8460P Core i5 2420m 2.5ghz 8 GB RAM (originally came with 4 GB) AMD Radeon HD 6470m 1GB 300 GB HDD, 7200 RPM Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit The problem: When it is on, but not plugged in with the AC adapter, it's only a matter of time before it abruptly shuts off, even if the battery level shows up to 90% or higher remaining. These days, many Linux users are gaming more frequently than before. However, some of us are not lucky enough to have newer capable PCs. As a result, we have to game using our laptops. In my recent test, just by putting my laptop over a book (without blocking the fan at the bottom of the laptop), I was able to keep the temperature of the laptop under 80 degree celsius (while playing games), thus maintaining a fairly playable FPS. I have tested this both with radeon and intel open source drivers. Hi, I tried to install Ubuntu a bit of time ago (dual boot with Windows 8) and I succesfully did it, but the problem is I have a HP Pavilion G6 and (I searched on the Internet and almost all HP g6/dv6 are affected by this problem) it used to heat SO MUCH more than Windows, with the fan at maximum speed and super-hot while doing nothing with my PC. When I tried to watch videos they used to play slow, and repeat scenes maybe for the heat. Now, I want to reinstall Ubuntu, but I can't if this proble. Well, i recently began mining with CPU but a lot of friends told me to switch to GPU mining since i have a radeon 6470m, the problem is my cgminer doesn't show anything when i start it it goes from : start cgminer 3.7.2 and then it just go black. I have an HP pavilion g6, with intel hd 3000+ Radeon hd 6470m, i5, 6go ram! All drivers are new ( AMD_Catalyst_13.11_Mobility_BetaV9.2 enduro. 
I have an xp laptop (no hope of changing parts) with xp installed. The sound requires the conexant CX20671 driver but I can only find one for win 7. I have the same issue with my Radeon HD 6470M, only win 7 drivers exist that I can find. Is there some workaround the using them without purchasing windows. I'm gonna start this whole thing off with saying that I am awful with computers. Completely and utterly. Okay, so, I've been having issues with my laptop lately and they all seem to tie back to my graphics card in some way. I've been getting a BSOD a couple times a week with the error message of "IRQL_LESS_OR_NOT_EQUAL." Based on some Google searching I have gathered that it has something to do with my graphics card, either that it needs to be updated or some other fix. The message boards. Hello! I once restarted my computer and got a loop of Blue Screens of Death (BSoD). I did a fresh install of my OS and when I tried to install my VGA's driver, the same BSoD occured. (I've used the one directly from the manufacturer's DVD). I tried some of Dell's Website, AMD's Website and even Leshcat's Website, but all of them are actually incompatible with this video card, not causing Blue Screens, but nor making the VGA work. I did updated the BIOS, but nothing changed. I also ran memtes. These are my results from system requirements lab. The only aspect I fail minimum on is on the cpu and i reach at least recommended on all the others. Im wondering if anyone knows if i would still be able to run the game despite this.

I'm using and Hp-Pavillion G7 1270-ca. The laptop has an AMD Radeon 6470m GPU, but I am unable to use it. I've tried using the drivers from the AMD website and they do not work. The drivers from the HP website give me the option to switch graphics, but they don't work either and installing these drivers actually downgrades my Intel HD 3000 drivers to Intel Graphics Family. I have been at this since yesterday and I am truly lost. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have a acer aspire 7551g and just got a new tv today, I am having trouble getting the tv to been full screen and not looking 800 x 600. I have reformatted the hard drive and downloaded all the driver for the computer (I think). I have a AMD Radeon HD 6470M graphics card. Let me know if I have forgotten anything. Thanks.

My laptop HP Pavilion G6-1068SE has Intel HD 3000 On Board Graphics along with 1GB discrete Radeon HD 6470M graphics.

I have an HP Laptop running Windows 7 (with all vital/recommended updates installed), about 5 years old. The laptop came with two graphics cards built in - one for saving battery life, and the other higher performance one for gaming and the like (ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4200 Series and AMD Radeon HD 6470M). The laptop came with an "AMD Catalyst Control Centre" already installed, which you could open up and choose your active graphics card. A little while ago, I was having issues. I have a Sony VAIO S Series. ------------------ System Information ------------------ Time of this report: 7/11/2012, 12:28:19 Machine name: HAL9000 Operating System: Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit (6.1, Build 7601) Service Pack 1 (7601.win7sp1_gdr.120503-2030) Language: English (Regional Setting: English) System Manufacturer: Sony Corporation System Model: VPCSC31FM BIOS: InsydeH2O Version HuronRiver.3.61.05.2051R2084H4 Processor: Intel(R).
