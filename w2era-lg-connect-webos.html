Anyone have success? I can't get my Nexus to pick up my TV for some reason. I can broadcast via YouTube, Netflix etc though. I've recently bought a LG Smart TV running webOS (49UH610T, firmware version 0.4.20.25) and it's a good TV overall. There is one issue, however, drives me crazy: whenever I try to connect my HTL23 phone (running Lollipop 5.0.2, sw number 3.39.970.1) via miracast to my TV, it just crashes and reboot. Do you have any experience on this issue? Please let me know, I really appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Note: my laptop can normally project on it using Widi with no problems.

I purchased an LG C8 basically in December of 2018. Since then I've upgraded my PS4 to a PS4 Pro and purchased a Panasonic UB820 to play 4K Bluray. I got the PS4 Pro because I thought it would depreciate better than the PS4 while I wait on the PS5 and in the mean time I could enjoy the few games I play in the best quality. Very disappointed in it as a media player. I don't use the streaming services on either the UB820 or the PS4 Pro. They are purely for physical media; movies and games respecti.

Hi everyone. Current I have a few first generation models of the Fire TV Stick and a Fire Cube. Of course right after I got the Cube, the Fire TV Stick 4K was announced with Dolby 4K support, which the Cube doesn't have. One thing I love about the Cube however is being able to turn the TV on and off with my voice, connect to the soundbar, and switch between inputs without using a remote. I know you can pair an Echo or Echo Dot with the Fire TV Stick 4K for voice control without the remote I jumped ship to Garmin in March, buying a vivoactive 3 in anticipation of the server shutdown. I knew that Pebbles would still work after the shutdown (and thanks to Rebble have gotten back some functionality the servers provided) but I wasn't sure that I wanted to be part of yet another failing OS (any former webOS users here?). Some frustration over the relative inaccuracy of things like sleep and step tracking was also beginning to catch up to me, so I decided to pull the trigger

The second WiFi is connected over vpn. I can access Internet fine via the webos browser. I can access Netflix via ipad and android phone using the vpn WiFi router.

I currently have a lg smart tv(UH664V) with webOS 3.0 I just got a google home and need webOS 4.0 to connect it to my tv. is there anyway to update Hi, I am having trouble screen casting to a new TV (LG 43uk6400plf), from both my phone and my dad's tablet. The TV shows up in wireless displays and when I click on it, I get a notification on the TV that my device requests to share screens, I only get an option to decline. After a few seconds the pop up goes away and I get an error saying unable to connect for screen sharing, try again. Both devices are connected to the same network, I have tried both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks. I have asked. Hi, I don't know if this is the right place to post but I got no reply on the webos subreddit. I got a new TV (LG 43uk6400), and I can't screen cast. If I click to cast it comes up on the TV that my note 4x wants to cast, but then it comes up unable to connect for screen sharing. My laptop connects fine. Has anyone here have problems casting, or can you cast to your LG TV fine? Thanks. I'm really interested to order the full lightpack v2 but still I have some questions : \- I have the OLED 65C8 from LG, and I watch my series on Netflix and Amazon through the WebOS of the TV, which I connect to my ampli throught HDMI ARC to receive the sound.

Hi, I am running dockerized hass.io 0.80.3 and I have a problem with the WebOS component (https://www.home-assistant.io/components/media_player.webostv/): I added the configuration.yaml entry, I do receive a card that I need to pair my TV, but once I start to pair I don't get anything on my TV and I have the following error message in HA: `register failed to connect to ws://ip.adress.of.tv:3000` (coming from `"components/media_player/webostv.py (ERROR)"`) This is my configuration.yaml entry. I got a new LG TV and it has WebOS on it. I thought it would be cool to make an app that will have a tableview list of apps on the TV and selecting one would launch that app (Netflix, Hulu, etc). I'm currently using Connect SDK ( to interact with the TV. I've been able to do some basic things through the SDK, but I'm running into some roadblocks. My question is, does anyone have experience interacting with smart TV's (specifically I have bought an LG B7 and have experienced stuttering when playing a 4K movie. I'd like to diagnose the problem.
